            of the applicable term, unless terminated earlier as outlined in
            these Terms. Your Subscription Plan will automatically renew for
            subsequent periods (either monthly or annually) unless you cancel
            before the next billing cycle begins.
          </p>
          <h4>3.2 FLY FX‚Äôs Right to Terminate.</h4>
          <p>
            FLY FX may terminate or restrict your access to the FLY FX Data at
            any time if you breach these Terms, engage in illegal or fraudulent
            use of the FLY FX Data, or if such action is necessary to protect
            FLY FX, its partners, or others from fraudulent activities or to
            comply with legal requirements. If FLY FX chooses to terminate or
            restrict access without cause, we will attempt to notify you in
            advance.
          </p>
          <h4>3.3 Your Right to Terminate.</h4>
          <p>
            You may cancel your Subscription Plan at any time. If you do, you
            will retain access to the FLY FX Data until the end of your billing
            period. Unless required by law, payments are non-refundable, and no
            refunds or credits will be provided for partial Subscription Plan
            periods.

          </p>
          <h4>4.2 Subscription Fees.</h4>
          <p>
            Once your free trial period has expired, you are required to pay FLY
            FX a non-refundable subscription fee either on a monthly or annual
            basis, depending on your selected plan ("Subscription Fee"). Unless
            you cancel your Subscription Plan before the start of the next
            billing cycle, you authorize us to charge the next Subscription Fee
            to the payment method linked to your Account.
          </p>
          <h4>4.3 Free Trial.</h4>

          <p>
            FLY FX reserves the right to adjust the Subscription Fees at the end
            of your billing cycle, whether monthly or annually. We will inform
            you of any fee increase at least 30 days before your next billing
            cycle begins. If you disagree with the increase in Subscription
            Fees, you may choose to cancel your plan before the new billing
            cycle starts.
          </p>
          <h2>SECTION 5 ‚Äì SERVICES AND DATA</h2>
          <h4>5.1 Responsibility for Software and Hardware.</h4>

          <h4>5.2 Inaccessibility or Inoperability of Services.</h4>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that there may be times when the FLY FX Data becomes
            inaccessible or inoperable for reasons beyond FLY FX's control, such
            as:
          </p>
          <ol type="i" class="terms-list">
            <li>hardware malfunctions;</li>
            <li>software issues;</li>
            <li>
              routine maintenance or repairs that FLY FX may perform
              periodically; or
            </li>
            <li>
              events that are beyond FLY FX's reasonable control and are not
              foreseeable.

          <h4>5.3 Changes to Content or Format.</h4>
          <p>
            FLY FX may, at its discretion, update or modify the content or
            format of the FLY FX Data to:
          </p>
          <ol type="a" class="terms-list">
            <li>improve the quality or delivery of services;</li>

            <li>improve cost efficiency or performance; or</li>
            <li>
              comply with legal requirements. While FLY FX will strive to
              provide advance notice of such changes, it is not always possible
              to give significant notice due to the dynamic nature of financial
              markets and currency data changes.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>5.5 Cancellation.</h4>

          <p>
            When you cancel a monthly Subscription Plan, all future charges will
            be halted, and your cancellation will take effect at the end of the
            current monthly billing period. No refunds will be issued, but you
            will retain access to the service until the end of the current
            month.
          </p>
          <h4>5.7 Cancellation of Annual Subscription Plans.</h4>
          <p>
            If you cancel an annual Subscription Plan, the cancellation will be
            effective at the end of the current annual billing period. No
            refunds or prorated credits will be given for any portion of the
            year, but you will continue to have access to the service until the
            conclusion of the current billing cycle.
          </p>

          <h2>SECTION 7 ‚Äì DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES</h2>
          <h4>7.1 Good Faith Provision.</h4>
          <p>
            FLY FX provides the FLY FX Data in good faith, and while FLY FX
            makes reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
            the data, it does not guarantee or warrant:
          </p>
          <ol type="i" class="terms-list">
            <li>
              the precision, authenticity, timeliness, dependability,
              appropriateness, correct sequencing, or completeness of the FLY FX
              Data; or
            </li>
            <li>that the FLY FX Data is free from errors or defects.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>7.2 No Liability Assumed.</h4>
          <p>
            FLY FX does not assume any responsibility for how you (or any users
            accessing your Account) use the FLY FX Data.
          </p>
          <h4>7.3 Disclaimer of Warranties.</h4>
          <p>
            The FLY FX Data is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available,‚Äù with no
            warranties of any kind. FLY FX, along with its affiliates, agents,
            suppliers, officers, directors, and employees, explicitly disclaims
            any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to
            implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose, and non-infringement of third-party rights. Under no
            circumstances will FLY FX be liable for indirect, special, punitive,
            or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits
            or data. If any of the limitations or disclaimers in this section
            are deemed ineffective by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
            parties agree that FLY FX‚Äôs total liability to you and all users of
            your Account, regardless of the legal basis (contract, tort, strict
            liability, etc.), will not exceed the total Subscription Fees you
            paid during the preceding twelve (12) months for the FLY FX Data
            license.
          </p>
          <h4>
            7.4 Nature of Data and Non-Affiliation with Financial Institutions.
          </h4>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that FLY FX is not a financial institution or a
            provider of financial data feeds, and it obtains financial data,
            including the FLY FX Data, from various sources. Financial data can
            vary across institutions and regions, particularly for non-major or
            exotic currencies, and may differ from the data provided by FLY FX.
            Although FLY FX strives to provide accurate and timely data from
            these sources, it makes no representations or warranties regarding
            the accuracy, timeliness, reliability, or completeness of the FLY FX
            Data. You also acknowledge that the FLY FX Data does not constitute
            financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. You should seek
            independent professional guidance before making decisions related to
            these areas.
          </p>
          <h4>7.5 No Guarantee of Uninterrupted Service.</h4>
          <p>
            FLY FX does not warrant that the FLY FX Data will be continuous or
            error-free, nor does it guarantee that any errors will be corrected.
          </p>
          <h4>7.6 Limitation of Liability.</h4>
          <p>
            In no event will FLY FX, its affiliates, or any of their data
            providers be liable to you or any users accessing your Account for
            interruptions, delays, inoperability, inaccuracies, or omissions in
            the FLY FX Data, regardless of the cause, or for any resulting
            losses, damages, liabilities, or expenses. This applies even if FLY
            FX was aware or should have been aware of the potential for such
            issues.
          </p>
          <h4>7.7 Fairness of Liability Limitations.</h4>
          <p>
            You represent that the liability limitations outlined in these Terms
            are fair and reasonable, considering the nature of the Terms. These
            limitations were a factor in FLY FX‚Äôs decision to enter into the
            agreement and in calculating the Subscription Fee, which would not
            have been agreed upon without such limitations.
          </p>
          <h4>7.8 Indemnification by You.</h4>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless FLY FX, its
            affiliates, subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees,
            and agents from any loss, damage, liability, or expense (including
            reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from:
          </p>
          <ol type="i" class="terms-list">
            <li>
              any actions or omissions by you or anyone associated with you in
              relation to these Terms and/or the FLY FX Data (including any use
              or reliance on the data by users accessing your Account); and
            </li>
            <li>
              any failure to fulfill, breach, or misrepresentation of any
              obligations under these Terms.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>SECTION 8 ‚Äì GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>
          <h4>8.1 Complete Agreement.</h4>
          <p>
            These Terms, together with FLY FX‚Äôs Privacy Notice (which can be
            accessed here: [FLY FX - Privacy Policy]), represent the full and
            final agreement between the parties and replace any prior oral or
            written agreements related to the subject matter.
          </p>
          <h4>8.2 Modifications.</h4>
          <p>
            Given the evolving nature of FLY FX‚Äôs data suppliers and partner
            relationships, FLY FX reserves the right to modify these Terms and
            any referenced documents (including our Privacy Notice) at its sole
            discretion. These amendments will be posted on the FLY FX Help
            Centre (available here: [FLY FX - Terms of Use]). By continuing to
            use the FLY FX Data, you consent to the updated Terms.
          </p>
          <h4>8.3 Headings.</h4>
          <p>
            The section titles in these Terms are included solely for
            convenience and do not form part of the actual agreement. They are
            not intended to fully or accurately describe the content of the
            sections.
          </p>
          <h4>8.4 Gender.</h4>
          <p>
            Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms used in these
            Terms are meant to include all genders, whether masculine, feminine,
            or neutral.
          </p>
          <h4>8.5 Severability.</h4>
          <p>
            If any provision in these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or
            unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be removed
            to the extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will continue
            in effect to give effect to the parties' original intent.
          </p>
          <h4>8.6 Waiver.</h4>
          <p>
            Any waiver of rights or failure by FLY FX to enforce any right or
            provision in these Terms does not constitute a waiver of future
            enforcement of that right or any other right under these Terms.
          </p>
          <h4>8.7 Governing Law.</h4>
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
            Nigeria, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. All rights
            and remedies available under these Terms or by law are cumulative
            and can be exercised independently or together. The parties agree to
            submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Lagos,
            Nigeria.
          </p>
          <h4>8.8 Exclusion of Sale of Goods Provisions.</h4>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that these Terms are not governed by the UN
            Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or the
            International Sale of Goods Act, as amended. Furthermore, the
            provisions of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act
            (UCITA) do not apply to these Terms. If UCITA were to apply, both
            parties opt out of its applicability.
          </p>
          <h4>8.9 Delayed Performance.</h4>
          <p>
            Unless explicitly stated otherwise, if FLY FX is unable to meet any
            deadlines or performance requirements due to circumstances beyond
            its reasonable control, those deadlines will be extended for the
            duration of the delay.
          </p>
          <h4>8.10 Independent Legal Advice.</h4>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that you have had the opportunity to seek
            independent legal advice regarding these Terms and understand their
            implications, even if you choose not to consult a lawyer.
